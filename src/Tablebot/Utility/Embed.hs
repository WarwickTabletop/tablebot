-- | Some helper functions to allow progressively building up an embed
-- If you need something more complex, you can still use the createEmbed flow provided by discord-haskell,
-- its not bad (once you realise that it turns empty strings into Nothing for you...) but it can't do colours.
-- To add a colour run createEmbed on it and then use one of these functions to manipulate it
